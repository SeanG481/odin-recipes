        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the 
            base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake 
            until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and 
            freezes well, too.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic over medium
                heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatos, 
                tomato paste, tomato sauce and water. Season with
                sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt,
                pepper, and parsley. Simmer, covered, for 1.5 hrs,
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
                water for 8-10 mins. Drain noodles and rinse with cold
                water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta with egg,
                parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)</li>
            <li>Spread 1.5 cups meat sauce in bottom of 9x13-inch 
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles over sauce lengthwise.
                Spread with half the ricotta mixture. Top with a third
                of mozzarella slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat sauce over 
                mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Cover
                with foil (to prevent sticking, spray with cooking
                spray or make sure foil doesn't touch cheese).
            </li>
            <li>Bake in heated oven for 25 mins. Remove foil and bake
                an additional 25 mins. Cool for 15 mins before serving.
            </li>
