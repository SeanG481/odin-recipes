        <p>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, 
            designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 
                8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium 
                heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, 
                about 5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring 
                continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture 
                is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure 
                the milk doesn't burn.
            </li>
            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.
